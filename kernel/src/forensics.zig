//! Last-words recorder (claim #1278 — the unblock for #1261).
//!
//! ## Why this is a trace and not a crash handler
//!
//! A boot can end with the VM in `VZVirtualMachine.State.error` and literally
//! nothing else: no `[EXC]` block (so no synchronous exception was taken), no
//! tombstone, and the last serial line an ordinary one (`wnd: present`). #1261
//! spent a full investigation on that, and the reason it could not get further
//! is structural:
//!
//!   * **Guest RAM is not readable post-mortem.** VZ exposes no memory dump, so
//!     a ring of records in BSS dies with the guest. The existing
//!     `serial_ring.zig` is RAM-only and has the same problem.
//!   * **A crash handler needs the guest to run one.** If the death takes no
//!     exception, no handler is entered. There is nothing to hook.
//!
//! Therefore a record only survives if it **reaches serial before the death**.
//! The design follows from that single constraint:
//!
//!   * `note()` is cheap and callable from ANY context, including IRQ: a
//!     per-core counter and one fixed-size BSS slot. No allocation, no lock, no
//!     console, no comparator write.
//!   * `note()` never prints. Emission is deferred to the console write path,
//!     so **the next ordinary line the guest prints carries the pending records
//!     with it**. The kernel's "no console in IRQ context" rule is preserved
//!     exactly: printing still only ever happens on the path that was already
//!     printing, and the recorder just contributes a prefix to it.
//!
//! The consequence for a dying boot: whatever line ends up last in the serial
//! log is immediately preceded by the records of everything the guest did just
//! before it, so the tail names the last instant instead of stopping at an
//! ordinary line.
//!
//! ## Race-freedom without atomics
//!
//! The kernel uses spinlocks and no `@atomicRmw` anywhere, and this path must
//! not take a lock (it runs in IRQ context, where a lock held by the
//! interrupted context on the same core would self-deadlock). So the ring is
//! partitioned instead: each core owns `per_core` private slots and writes only
//! its own, which needs no synchronization at all. A reader can catch a slot
//! mid-write and see a torn record; that is accepted, because a torn record
//! still names a site and a core, which is the whole question being asked.
//!
//! Off by default (`enabled == false`), so a default boot reaches none of this:
//! `note()` returns on its first byte and no hook is installed.

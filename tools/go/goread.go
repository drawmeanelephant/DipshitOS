// M70c (#1455) fixture: the guest reads a MULTI-MEGABYTE file from the host
// share end to end and reports what it cost.
//
// Why this exists. S1/S2 (compile + link in-guest) have to move a Go
// toolchain's inputs across the host file channel, and ADR 0035 named
// in-guest transfer throughput as unmeasured — the card's own first
// instruction is "measure the honest transfer and mmap story first and record
// it". The mmap half landed with M70c-K (#1504); this is the transfer half.
// Two facts in the tree make the useful question specific:
//
//   - the EL0 read surface clamps ONE sys_file_read to 2048 bytes
//     (kernel/src/syscall.zig handle_file_read: take_count = @min(count, 2048)),
//     while the WIRE reply cap is 32 KiB (virtio_file.reply_cap) — so a 27 MB
//     payload is ~13,200 syscalls, not ~845;
//   - each of those syscalls is one virtio round trip (file_table.read loops
//     virtio_file.read_chunk at the handle's cursor — "the host share is
//     stateless").
//
// So the number that matters is CALLS PER SECOND at the cap, not bytes per
// second at some buffer size the kernel will not honour. The fixture reads the
// whole file with the cap-sized buffer the guest SDK itself uses
// (vsys.MaxFileIOBytes), counts calls, and hashes every byte as it arrives —
// the hash is what makes the read unforgeable: a short read, a dropped chunk,
// a wrong offset or a page of zeros is a different number, and the gate
// recomputes it on macOS from the file it staged.
//
// The call count is an OBSERVATION of the clamp, not an assumption:
// ceil(bytes / 2048) is only reachable if the kernel really does move 2048
// bytes per call, so the gate asserts it exactly. If the cap ever moves, that
// assert fails by name — which is the point, because ADR 0035's transfer
// arithmetic would have to be re-derived rather than inherited.
//
// Imports: `vsys` only, deliberately. It carries both the clock (Nanotime,
// CNTPCT_EL0) and the os.File-shaped share API, and it costs ~0.6 KB of the
// GOOS=virelai link recipe's 576 KiB rodata window; `vi` (which the other
// fixtures use) costs ~5.4 KB, and the window is not big enough for both.

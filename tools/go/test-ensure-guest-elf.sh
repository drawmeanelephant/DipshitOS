# test-ensure-guest-elf.sh -- class-A self-test for tools/go/ensure-guest-elf.sh
# (issue #1503). A checker whose negative path is never exercised can be
# wired backwards and still report green, so the stale/missing/foreign-ELF
# refusals are asserted here with no VM and no Go toolchain.
#
# Hermetic: ENSURE_GUEST_ELF_ROOT points at a temp tree; builders are stubs
# that write a byte string. The real live-sh / live-ssh-server specs are
# read only to pin needed-by detection.

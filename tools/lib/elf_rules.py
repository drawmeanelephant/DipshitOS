"""The loader rules the kernel enforces, checked from the host.

One copy on purpose. Two class-B specs check a GUEST-BUILT ELF against exactly
these rules before a later boot is allowed to execute it:

  * ``go-hello.spec`` run 07 (the monitor-driven link, M70c-S1T / #1543), and
  * ``live-selfhost-go.spec`` run 01 (the guest-sequenced build loop, M70c-S2 /
    #1544).

A rule that drifts in one copy is worse than a rule that is missing: the host
would pass an image the kernel then refuses, and the failure would surface as a
boot-time refusal far from the check that lied. The constants below mirror
``kernel/src/exec.zig`` (``exec_image_max``/``load_max``, ``max_segments``, the
argv+envp block) and ``kernel/src/elf.zig`` (``load_max``, ``map_max``,
``gap_base_max``) -- KEEP IN SYNC with THOSE, not with a sibling spec.

M72a (#1579) SPLIT that rule: the loader bounds INITIALIZED bytes (``Σ filesz``)
by ``load_max`` and MAPPED bytes (``Σ memsz``, which it eagerly allocates and
zeroes) by ``map_max``. This copy charged ``Σ memsz`` against the 32 MiB file
bound, so it refused -- from the host, before any boot -- exactly the images
the kernel had just learned to accept, which is the drift this module exists to
prevent.

Usage from a spec's ``vgate_assert <tag> python`` body::

# fleet.sh -- the gate fleet, discovered from the spec dir (M40 GF5, issue
# #940). The spec list under tools/gate/specs/ is the single source of
# truth: every entry point (the `just gate`/`just gates`/`just verify-vz`
# recipes, the vz-gates.yml CI shards, docs/gate-inventory.md) is derived
# from what this library finds on disk. Adding or removing a spec file
# changes every entry point with zero list edits anywhere.
#
# The fleet is ALL of:
#   - every tools/gate/specs/*.spec (run through tools/gate/vgate.sh), plus
#   - the LEGACY_SCRIPTS below: the four class-B gates that predate the
#     spec format and were sharded by the pre-GF5 archive GATE block.
#     serial-takeover (`zig build run`) is deliberately NOT in the fleet:
#     it is an interactive console takeover (needs a TTY) and is excluded
#     from automation exactly as it was before GF5. Run it with `just run`.
#
# Suites are not curated lists: `gates <pattern>` runs every fleet member
# whose id contains the pattern as a substring. There is nothing to
# maintain — a new spec named live-foo-* is immediately in `just gates foo`.
#
# Subcommands (also usable directly, no `just` required):
#   list              one "kind<TAB>id" line per fleet member, LC_ALL=C
#                     sorted (kind: spec | script) — what CI shards on
#   count             member count
#   ids [pattern]     member ids, optionally substring-filtered
#   match <pattern>   ids matching a substring (errors when none)
#   resolve <id>      echo the id for an exact name or unique prefix
#   run <id|pattern>...  run the named members (or pattern groups), fail
#                        at the end if any failed; evidence under artifacts/
#   verify-vz         run the WHOLE fleet sequentially (the `just verify-vz`
#                     body). BOOTS/VIRELAI_GATE_SUFFIX/... pass through to
#                     vgate.sh exactly as documented in tools/gate/SPEC.md.
#
# Environment: VIRELAI_GATE_SUFFIX, VGATE_NO_BUILD, BOOTS honored by
# vgate.sh; fleet.sh adds nothing of its own.
#
# Dev-shell note (the one canonical PATH paragraph): fleet members need the
# modern Homebrew toolchain exactly like CI — /opt/homebrew/bin FIRST and
# /opt/homebrew/opt/gnu-sed/libexec/gnubin for GNU sed. That is byte-for-byte
# what .github/workflows/vz-gates.yml ("Put Homebrew toolchain on PATH") and
# .github/workflows/ci.yml set up. Locally, `source tools/env-check.sh`
# verifies the same thing and complains loudly when the 2007-era system
# bash/sed win instead.

# live-sh.spec -- M45 card SH2 class-B gate (issue #1078, ADR 0021 D2/D3),
# retargeted to GOSH by M68b (#1450).
#
# The gate's subject is the *shell*, not the binary that hosts it: an EL0
# shell opens /dev/tty, attaches the SERIAL console, prompts, and dispatches
# through its core. A scripted burst proves the core live: `echo` (builtin),
# `cd /data` + `$PWD` expansion, external `status43` resolved
# case-insensitively (status43 -> STATUS43.BIN) and run foreground, then
# Up-history re-runs it (status43: alive twice). M69f2 (#1538) adds the
# discovery half of the M49 bar: `help` (grouped catalog, ADR 0008 D1),
# `help <cmd>` (usage + description) and the D3 unknown-verb shape, all
# typed at the same prompt so a shell that never ran cannot pass them.
# Markers are single writes.
# `GOSH.ELF serial` is the Go front-end owner of that console
# (sys_tty_attach selector 1, ADR 0020), so every assert is unchanged except
# the binary and its marker prefix. Boot default unchanged.
#
#
# Run 02 is the M69f1 (#1537) persistent-recall beat: the SAME share boots
# again and ONE Up arrow (plus Enter) recalls the last line run 01
# submitted. Run 02 types no command text at all, so `status43: alive` in
# its log can only come from a line read back off /host/GOSH-HISTORY.TXT
# and then executed -- which is the whole card.
#
# HOST PREREQ: bash tools/go/build-gosh.sh -> .build/go/GOSH.ELF

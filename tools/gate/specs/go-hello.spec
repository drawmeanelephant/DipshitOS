# go-hello.spec -- issue #1163, GOOS=virelai phase 0a: the gc Go runtime
# runs on VirelaiOS. Runs 01-03 (M70c-K, #1504): svc #0 console + sbrk heap +
# GC; a >9 MiB image STREAMED into its mapped pages; the two refusals by name.
# Run 04 (M70c, #1455): the guest reads that same 9.5 MiB from the share
# end to end at the ABI's 2048-byte read cap — bytes, call count and FNV hash
# asserted against the file on macOS, the rate reported (ADR 0035 measures it).
# Run 05 (M70c-S1L, #1540): the std fixture — a Go program whose file I/O goes
# through `os`/`fmt` (the #1525 port) instead of the guest SDK — RUNS. Its own
# output is held to the file on macOS: the whole 9.5 MiB image read through
# os.File and hashed, os.Mkdir/WriteFile/ReadDir/Stat/Remove exercised in a
# directory the fixture creates (so the entry counts are exact), and the
# removes checked from the host's copy of the share afterwards. The aperture
# that used to refuse this image is fixed in the runtime's break base, and the
# run also pins the two port bugs it caught (ADR 0035 amendment 4).
# Runs 06-08 (M70c-S1T, #1543): the guest's OWN cmd/compile and cmd/link build
# tools/go/hello.go in the guest (object -> ELF), and the ELF the guest linked
# runs and prints the pinned lines. The in-guest memory samples (run 06/07) are
# the ADR 0035 D6 figure: reported, not asserted, because a footprint is a
# property of the machine.
# Runs 09-10 (M69e, #1532): the DAILY LOOP, and the only boots here where a
# compiler runs because of the guest's own action. Run 09 has the guest author
# a Go source on /host with the monitor's `write` verb; the Mac compiles THAT
# file between the two boots (a python hook on run 09, so the compile sits
# after the edit and before the run); run 10 executes the image the Mac built
# from the guest's own bytes. The guest never sees a compiler - both runs
# assert the host's own receipt line absent from their serial.
# HOST PREREQUISITE: `.build/go/{GOHELLO,GOBIG,GOREAD,GOSYSCALL}.ELF` must exist
# first via `bash tools/go/build-go.sh tools/go/hello.go tools/go/gobig.go
# tools/go/goread.go tools/go/gosyscall.go` (fork prerequisites in
# tools/go/README.md); runs 06-08 additionally need `bash tools/go/build-gotool.sh`
# (the GOOS=virelai toolchain images) and `bash tools/go/stage-selfhost.sh`
# (the import config + package archives the guest's linker resolves against).
# Runs 09-10 need only that same fork toolchain: the harness compiles in the
# gate, and refuses (before any boot) when `$GO_FORK_DIR/bin/go` is missing.
# exec-order: assert-proven — a run cannot go green without the program's own output. See tools/gate/SPEC.md.

# M70c-S1L (issue #1540) run 05: an `os`-importing image runs at all.

# The run is the assertion that the aperture story moved: before this card the
# same binary loaded and then died in `runtime.mallocinit` with "cannot allocate
# memory", because its break base landed inside the data aperture the kernel
# protects through the argv+envp block. Nothing about the guest's arithmetic is
# asserted here — the card's claim is that a std program executes, and the
# fixture's own output is what proves it. Where a number has to come from
# somewhere other than the guest, it comes from the file on macOS: the 9.5 MiB
# image is read through os.File and folded into FNV-1a by the host too, the
# second raw read is checked against the staged file's own byte at that offset,
# the directory it walks is one it created (so the exact entry counts are
# assertable), and the remove is checked from the host side of the share.

# --- M70c-S1T (issue #1543): the guest builds, with its own toolchain --------

# The chain is three boots because the monitor's `exec` returns immediately
# (tools/gate/SPEC.md): the share carries the intermediate between runs, and
# each run ends on the guest's own exit-status line, which the scheduler prints
# (`procs <name> exited status=<n>`). The intermediate is a real artifact of
# the guest: run 07 links the object run 06 compiled, and run 08 executes the
# ELF run 07 produced.
#
# The argv is what the kernel's 8x32-byte block allows (kernel/src/exec.zig
# max_exec_args/arg_slot_bytes), which is why the flags are terse and the
# import config is one flat file in the share; tools/go/stage-selfhost.sh
# checks those lines against the budget before a boot is spent on them.

# --- M69e (issue #1532): the daily loop, one boot per step --------------------
#
# The card's loop is edit -> compile -> run, and unlike the selfhost chain above
# the STEPS ARE SEQUENCED: the harness evaluates a run's asserts between runs,
# so run 09's hook compiles the file the guest just wrote and run 10 runs the
# result. What the guest authored is a ONE-LINE program (it has to be: the
# monitor's `write` joins its arguments and appends no newline), so the loop
# fixture lives on the share instead of in `tools/go/` - there is nothing to
# keep in sync, and no new demo app.
#
# D1 (the compiler is the Mac) is pinned rather than promised: the compile's
# receipt line `loop: host-built ...` is printed by the HOST into the gate log,
# and both runs assert that line absent from their own serial, so a future
# version that types a compiler banner into the guest console fails here.
#
# Run 09 writes, and stops on the monitor's own persistence report. That report
# carries the byte count, which the hook holds to the file it reads on macOS -
# the guest's claim about its edit and the host's copy of it have to agree.

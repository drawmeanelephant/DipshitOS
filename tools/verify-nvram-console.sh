# verify-nvram-console.sh -- claim 0015 gate: post-exit console bytes via
# the NVRAM variable channel (the VZ serial-gate successor step named by
# claim 0013).
#
# Problem (observed, claims 0002/0013): the first post-exit banner TX dies
# in the virtio-pci transport flush on VZ; vm-serial.log stays 0 B. The
# only proven post-exit device channel is EFI runtime SetVariable (the
# claim-0009 marker ladder persists post-exit).
#
# This gate: build the kernel with -Dnvram-console=true (console TX rides
# the NVRAM channel, never touching the hanging transport), boot it in a
# VZ VM, reconstruct the console stream from the chunk variables the kernel
# wrote (VirelaiC0..N, prefix "VIRELAIC <idx>:"), and assert the stream
# contains the takeover banner, the terminal state line, the virelai>
# prompt, and real command output (version, mem) from the scripted session.
#
# Flakiness: the VZ post-exit window is a documented flaky death site
# (claim 0009 — the ladder sometimes stops at M2_MAPD!, the MMU takeover,
# and sometimes later, e.g. mid map-dump after M2_TXOK!). The kernel is
# not at fault; VZ emulation is. This gate therefore retries the VM boot
# up to MAX_ATTEMPTS times with a fresh variable store each time, and
# passes on the first attempt whose reconstructed stream meets the
# assertions. Each attempt is logged under artifacts/.
#
# The serial channel is NOT the gate (it is provably silent on VZ); the
# NVRAM console channel is. Run on Apple silicon only (VZ VM).
#
# Usage: bash tools/verify-nvram-console.sh
# Evidence saved under artifacts/: nvram-console-gate.txt (this script),
# nvram-console-run.txt (runner output), nvram-console.log (reconstructed
# stream), efi-vars.bin (the variable store), vm-serial.log.

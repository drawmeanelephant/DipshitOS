# (docs/status.md gate work item 3, claim 0009).
#
# Gate: after a VZ boot, the kernel persists each takeover stage as the EFI
# non-volatile variable `VirelaiM2` (runtime SetVariable survives
# ExitBootServices on VZ — observed). The runner saves the ordered ladder of
# marker instances to artifacts/marker-dump.txt; this script asserts the
# ladder is present and names the kernel's final stage. This discriminates
# the two VZ serial-gate hypotheses:
#   * ladder ends at M2_SERIA -- the serial probe completed and found no
#     usable MMIO device in the declared windows (layout=none halt).
#   * ladder ends at M2_TABLE -- the identity-map build failed.
#   * ladder ends at M2_READY -- the virtio-pci console was discovered and
#     armed pre-exit (claim 0013, 2026-08-07), then the first banner TX died
#     (post-exit access to the transport hangs on VZ; vm-serial.log 0 B).
#   * a missing later stage (M2_ENTRY / M2_EXIT! / M2_MMUP! / M2_READY)
#     names the window in which the kernel crashed. Historical: before
#     claim 0010 the ladder always ended at M2_MAPD! (identity map built,
#     pre-install) with no M2_MMUP! -- the MMU switch itself was the death
#     site, and the kernel never reached the serial probe.
#
# NOTE on the memory-dump form: the original design scanned this process's
# address space for the BSS marker word on the assumption that the in-process
# VZ guest RAM is host-mapped. That is provably false on VZ (a full
# submap-aware walk finds no 256 MiB region; every M2_* hit is the runner's
# own constant array -- claim 0009). The NVRAM ladder is the working form.
#
# The serial channel is NOT the gate here (it is provably silent on VZ); the
# marker channel is. Run on Apple silicon only (VZ VM).
#
# Usage: bash tools/verify-marker.sh
# Evidence saved under artifacts/: m2-marker-gate.txt (this script),
# m2-marker-run.txt (runner output), marker-dump.txt (the ladder dump),
# efi-vars.bin (the variable store), plus the vm-serial.log.

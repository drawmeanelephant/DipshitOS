//          translates the frames — that is the point), so the N7 gate
//          asserts GUEST-OBSERVED COUNTERS, not capture bytes.
//          Mutually exclusive with --net (one network device per guest for
//          now); the fixed locally-administered MAC 02:00:00:00:00:01 is
//          set on the device config and what the guest actually observes
//          under NAT is a claim-time observation, pinned in the hardware
//          contract. OFF by default: without the flag

//          card N2, claim 6076: the host->guest RX direction of the SAME

//          end VZ delivers from, exactly ONCE, when <text> appears in the
//          serial log (default "net: rx-armed" — the guest's queue-0 RX
//          buffer is guaranteed supplied by then; deterministic, not a
//          sleep). Requires --net. OFF by default: the default VM — and the
//          29-gate aggregate — stays byte-identical. The injected bytes are
//          the KNOWN raw Ethernet frame the guest's net recv must print
//          byte-exact; the guest's netsend echo proves the round trip.)
//
// * --custom-virtio (macOS 27 spike, audit step 3): attaches one
//   default-off VZCustomVirtioDeviceConfiguration so the guest's PCI
//   discovery can observe it on a real VZ boot (VID 0x1af4, DID 0x1082,
//   class 0x00/0x00, 2 queues). Without the flag the VM configuration is
//   byte-identical to before — all existing gates are unchanged. NOTE:
//   Xcode 27 beta 4 exposes no host-triggered guest-interrupt API; the
//   spike proves discovery + queue transport (audit step 4) and the
//   used-ring IRQ via returnToQueue (audit step 5, claim 0828).
//
// * --nvram-console <file> (M1.5 VZ serial-gate successor, claim 0015):
//   before exiting, reconstruct the kernel's post-exit console stream from
//   the EFI variable store (artifacts/efi-vars.bin). In nvram-console
//   builds the kernel writes every console byte as chunked EFI variables
//   `DipshitC0`, `DipshitC1`, ... via runtime SetVariable — the one
//   post-exit-safe device channel on VZ (post-exit access to the
//   virtio-pci transport hangs, claim 0013). Each chunk value is prefixed
//   with the in-band marker `DIPSHITC <idx>:`; the host byte-scans the
//   store (file order == write order), validates the chunk indices, and
//   concatenates the payloads. The reconstructed text is written to
//   <file> and printed. In this mode the exit code is 0 iff reconstructed
//   output is non-empty — the NVRAM channel, not the (silent) serial
//   channel, is the gate. The serial evidence gate above is unchanged
//   when the flag is absent.
//
//   NOTE: the reconstructed bytes travelled the NVRAM variable channel,
//   NOT the virtio serial pipe — vm-serial.log stays 0 B. This is the
//   fallback channel claim 0013 named, and it makes post-exit console
//   evidence observable on VZ for the first time.
// * --dump-marker <file> (ADR 0004 D4 fixed-memory-marker fallback, gate
//   work item 3, claim 0009): before exiting, read the EFI variable store
//   (artifacts/efi-vars.bin) and save the ordered ladder of M2_* marker
//   instances the kernel wrote (the kernel persists each takeover stage as
//   the non-volatile variable `DipshitM2` via runtime SetVariable, which
//   survives ExitBootServices on VZ). In this mode the exit code is 0 iff at
//   least one marker instance was found — the marker channel, not the
//   (silent) serial channel, is the gate. The serial evidence gate above is
//   unchanged when the flag is absent.
//
//   NOTE: the original memory-dump form (scanning this process's address
//   space for the BSS marker, on the assumption that the in-process VZ guest
//   RAM is host-mapped) is provably impossible on VZ: a full submap-aware
//   walk finds no 256 MiB guest-RAM region and every M2_* hit is this
//   runner's own constant array (claim 0009, artifacts/marker-dump.txt). The
//   NVRAM ladder is the working form of the fallback.
//
// Two modes:
//   * default (evidence gate): starts the VZ guest, captures the
//     virtio-console serial stream to the log, and reports success only
//     after the requested serial line and terminal line have both been
//     observed. This is the milestone-two evidence path (`zig build run`)
//     and is unchanged by the M1.5 console work.
//   * --console (M1.5 host plumbing): duplex serial attachment. The
//     attachment's fileHandleForReading is a real host input source (stdin
//     forwarded through a pipe), guest output is teed live to the terminal
//     AND to the serial log, and the host terminal is put into character
//     mode with its original settings restored on normal exit, on
//     ^C / SIGTERM / SIGHUP, and on failure.
//
// Honest limits (see docs/status.md, ADR 0004):
//   * The guest serial console has NO RX path. Bytes forwarded to the
//     serial attachment enter the guest's virtio-console input device, but
//     nothing in this slice proves the kernel received them — guest RX is a
//     separate milestone slice. `--debug-input` only shows bytes handed to
//     the attachment, not guest receipt.
//   * The VZ serial gate is blocked as of 2026-08-06 (vm-serial.log empty in
//     every saved run), so console mode currently shows no guest output.
// No guest filesystem or POSIX dependency is added; the guest is untouched.

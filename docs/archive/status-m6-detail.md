| Six — graphics: Driving Award + Road Pops | Boot to a **graphical interface**: a virtio-gpu framebuffer (G1), framebuffer text rendering (G2), the boot terminal re-targeted to the screen as **Road Pops** (G3), and the **Driving Award** window manager compositing multiple windows (G5), and a draw/window syscall seam for EL0 programs (G6). Keyboard/pointer input (the original G4) was split into **milestone seven** (USB XHCI + HID) | ✅ **done 2026-08-13 (cards G1–G6 live)** — card G1 (**claim 6053**, branch `agent/buffy/m6-gpu`) **LIVE 2026-08-12 — the FIRST NON-BLANK GUEST FRAMEBUFFER on VZ**: the runner's `--display`/`--screenshot` mode attaches `VZVirtioGraphicsDeviceConfiguration` (1280×720 scanout; OFF by default — the default VM byte-identical); `kernel/src/virtio_gpu.zig` discovers the modern virtio-pci gpu (**DID 0x1050 observed**, class 0x038000, dev 7; config layout common@+0x0000 / ISR@+0x1000 / notify@+0x4000 / devcfg@+0x8000 — claim-0013's decoded shape), negotiates **VER1-only** (device offers RING_PACKED\|RING_EVENT_IDX\|RING_INDIRECT_DESC\|VERSION_1), arms controlq (queue 0) + cursorq (queue 1), re-arms post-exit (**VZ RESETS the gpu at ExitBootServices — `pre-rearm st=00`, like blk/entropy, unlike net's `st=0f`**), and drives the spec 2D path GET_DISPLAY_INFO → CREATE_2D (B8G8R8X8) → ATTACH_BACKING (4K-aligned BSS framebuffer) → SET_SCANOUT → TRANSFER → FLUSH. **Claim-time findings** (hardware-contract + claim doc): virtio-gpu **1.2** wire shapes (the 24-byte `display_one`; the pre-1.2 20-byte shape wedged the device with DEVICE_NEEDS_RESET), the tail descriptor's `next` must be 0 (VZ walks it), command/framebuffer cache cleans are mandatory (MMU-on, not caches-off), and the scanout composites with **alpha** — an X/A byte of 0 renders fully transparent (the final black-screen fix; fills write X=0xff). `screen` / `screen fill <rrggbb>` / `screen peek` monitor commands (registry 34→35). New class-B gate `bash tools/verify-live-screen.sh` **PASS 1/1** — the transport report + guest-side fill bytes + the DECODED capture: 14400/14400 sampled pixels are the fill green (0x00ff00 → ~(117,251,76) through the color-managed pipeline; evidence `artifacts/live-screen-*`, `artifacts/gpu-screen-*s`). Full class A green; the **35-gate `verify-vz` aggregate re-ran green** (`artifacts/m6-gpu-vz-sweep.log`). **Card G2 (claim 3194, branch `agent/buffy/m6-text`) LIVE 2026-08-12 — the machine boots to WORDS on the screen**: `kernel/src/text.zig` (the public-domain 8x8 bitmap font — ASCII 0x20–0x7e, fixed BSS glyph table; putc/puts, cursor, line wrap, a bounded 128-line scrollback ring, `clear`; the pure renderer is host-tested against an injectable mock canvas — 21 tests incl. golden glyphs, wrap/scroll/clear, bounds, cursor, composition) paints the SAME banner + prompt the serial log carries over G1's framebuffer (fg 0x00ff00 on bg 0x101418) and pushes it through G1's transfer/flush unchanged (`text: boot banner presented`); `text` / `text put <string>` / `text clear` monitor commands (registry 35→36). New class-B gate `bash tools/verify-live-text.sh` **PASS 1/1** — the DECODED capture shows real glyphs: the banner region samples fg=0.255 (green family) over bg=0.745 (the dark 0x101418) — the screen is no longer monochrome — with the region below all background (evidence `artifacts/live-text-*`, `artifacts/gpu-screen-*s`); the live-pixel bound is "text visible with the expected color family" (color-managed + retina-scaled; byte-exact glyphs live in the class A mock — the G1 gate's precedent). Full class A green; the **36-gate `verify-vz` aggregate re-ran green 36/36** (`artifacts/m6-text-vz-sweep.log`). **Card G3 (claim 1574, branch `agent/buffy/m6-roadpops`) LIVE 2026-08-12 — ROAD POPS: the boot terminal is on the screen**: `kernel/src/road_pops.zig` is a TEE console — every byte still reaches serial FIRST (the shared seam; the transcript gates keep passing byte-identical) AND G2's text layer paints the same banner + prompt + every reply on the framebuffer, drained ONE full-frame present per output batch by the shell idle loop. The G2 one-shot boot paint is replaced by the tee rendering the shell's OWN banner (its first present emits the G2 `text: boot banner presented` evidence on serial). **Claim-time fix (claim-0015 redux, observed live):** a `road_pops.Target` struct literal with all-constant fields was folded into `.rodata`, whose `&fn` entries hold LINK-TIME absolute addresses — the tee's first write jumped to the link-time `rp_text_put_bytes` and faulted (`esr=0x02000000 elr=0x14260`); the Target is now built in RAM like `ensure_vtable` so every `&fn` resolves PC-relatively. `roadpops` monitor command (registry 36→37: armed/dirty/presents). New class-B gate `bash tools/verify-live-roadpops.sh` **PASS 1/1** — the DECODED capture shows the boot banner (fg=0.255) AND the LIVE SESSION glyphs below it (fg=0.124 — the echoed `echo ROADPOPS`/`uname` commands + replies rendered; the screen is a working terminal, not a one-shot splash), with the serial transcript still carrying the whole session (evidence `artifacts/live-roadpops-*`, `artifacts/gpu-screen-*s`). G1/G2 gates updated honestly for the Road Pops reality: the terminal's drain-presents render over the raw fill, so G1's pixel phase now asserts the non-blank terminal frame (the fill is proven guest-side — `fill=…ff00 transfer=ok flush=ok` + `peek p1=0xff`; its `cmds=` is now session-dynamic), and the `text` report's cur/lines are session-dynamic (its own output feeds the ring). Full class A green; the **37-gate `verify-vz` aggregate re-ran green 37/37** (`artifacts/m6-roadpops-vz-sweep.log`) — the default VM stayed byte-identical. **Card G5 (claim 1543) LIVE 2026-08-13 — Driving Award, the window manager**: `kernel/src/driving_award.zig` (bounded BSS registry, z-order, focus, hit-test, dirty-rect compositor) makes Road Pops window 0 and a 1 Hz clock overlay window 1; the I3 keyboard read source is gated on the terminal's focus. `win`/`win focus <n>`/`win raise <n>`/`win hit <x> <y>` (registry 39→40). New class-B gate `bash tools/verify-live-win.sh` **PASS 1/1** — the serial session (windows=2, hit-test focusing the clock then the terminal) + a KEYBOARD-typed `uname` landing in the focused terminal (`DipshitOS aarch64`), and the DECODED capture shows two overlapping windows with the right z-order (the clock's amber title bar + navy body over the terminal, the terminal's green glyphs beside it). Full class A green; the default VM stayed byte-identical. **Card G6 (claim 0487) LIVE 2026-08-13 — the draw/window syscall seam**: the ADR 0007 amendment slots 12/13/14 (`sys_win_open`/`sys_win_fill`/`sys_win_present`, implemented 12 → 15, then a teardown follow-on adds slot 15 `sys_win_close` + `dui close` → 16) expose the G5 window manager's user-window surface to EL0 — `sys_win_open` opens a bounded kernel-owned window (id 2..3, fixed BSS back-buffer ≤ 256×192 B8G8R8X8), `sys_win_fill` fills rects, `sys_win_present` marks it dirty for the compositor (no uaccess — plain numbers; the kernel owns the buffers; the window persists after the caller exits, the honest bound). WIN.BIN (`user/src/win.zig`, the first graphics user program, loaded by `exec`) drives it end to end: `win: open id=2` → `win: fill ok` (dark-blue background + red/cyan/white blocks) → `win: present ok` → `sys_exit(87)`. New class-B gate `bash tools/verify-live-win-syscall.sh` **PASS 1/1** — the observation phase on the SAME kernel state (`win: windows=3 focused=2` + `win[2]: user user rect=64,64,256,192` z=2; `syscalls` implemented=16 with open=1/fill=4/present=1 + slot 15 `sys_win_close` registered) and the DECODED capture shows the window's own content over the terminal (no terminal foreground showing through — z-order). Full class A green; the default VM stayed byte-identical (sys_win_open returns EINVAL when the manager is unarmed). **Teardown follow-on (this branch):** `dui close <n>` (monitor) + `sys_win_close` (slot 15) release a user window so the id (2..3) can be re-opened instead of leaking until reboot — both call `driving_award.user_close`; open → fill → present → close → re-open is host-tested in `driving_award` + `syscall`, and a SEVENTH image WINCLOSE.BIN proves it LIVE from EL0: the class-B gate `tools/verify-live-win-close.sh` **PASS 1/1** — WINCLOSE.BIN opens/fills/presents/CLOSES (slot 15) and exits 88, twice; `win` shows `windows=2` after the close (no `win[2]:` row) and the re-exec re-opens id 2 (the freed slot reused, never id 3). **Ownership follow-on (this branch):** windows are OWNED by the opening process and AUTO-CLOSE when it exits (the scheduler's `exit_current` calls `driving_award.close_owner(pid)` — the real teardown semantic); `sys_win_fill`/`present`/`close` are owner-restricted (host-tested cross-process refusals); an EIGHTH image WINLOOP.BIN keeps its window alive so the restructured `tools/verify-live-win-syscall.sh` still pixel-proves EL0 rendering (WIN.BIN's window now vanishes on exit — `windows=2`, `sys_win_close calls=0`). **Move/raise follow-on (this branch):** slots 16/17 (`sys_win_move`/`sys_win_raise`, implemented 16 → 18) reposition + restack the caller's window from EL0 (move clamps on-scanout, raise reorders the z-order, both owner-restricted); the monitor's `win move <n> <x> <y>` is the EL1h half; a NINTH image WINMOVE.BIN drives it live and `tools/verify-live-win-move.sh` **PASS 1/1** shows the clamped rect (`win[2]: user user rect=1024,528,256,192`) + the counters (move=2/raise=1) + the decoded capture with the window's colors at the NEW position. **Read-back follow-on (this branch):** slot 18 (`sys_win_get`, implemented 18 → 19) copies the caller's window rect (four u32 LE words) OUT through uaccess — the ONE pointer-taking win slot — so an EL0 program reads its clamped position back after `sys_win_move`; WINMOVE.BIN now prints `winmove: get 1024,528,256,192` (the gate's get=1 + implemented=19 assertions). **Full-state query follow-on (this branch):** slot 19 (`sys_win_query`, implemented 19 → 20) copies the caller's window FULL state (eight u32 LE words: x, y, w, h, z, focused, visible, dirty) OUT through uaccess — so an EL0 program introspects z-order rank + focus + visible/dirty, not just the rect; WINMOVE.BIN now prints `winmove: query 1024,528,256,192 z=2 focused=1 visible=1 dirty=1` (the gate's query=1 + implemented=20 assertions). **Visibility follow-on (this branch):** slot 20 (`sys_win_set_visible`, implemented 20 → 21) HIDES (`visible` 0) or SHOWS (`visible` 1) the caller's window from EL0 (`driving_award.user_set_visible`, owner-restricted; the fixed terminal + clock are refused, a non-0/1 flag is EINVAL) — hiding marks the terminal dirty so the next composite repaints over the hidden window, showing marks the window dirty so it reappears; the back-buffer + z-order rank are untouched. WINMOVE.BIN now hides its window, sleeps 2 ticks, shows it again, and prints `winmove: hide ok` / `winmove: show ok`; `tools/verify-live-win-move.sh` asserts hide=1/show=1/set_visible=2 + implemented=21 and gained a marker-driven capture (`--screenshot-after "winmove: hide ok"`, a new VMRunner flag) proving the PIXEL DISAPPEARS (no red/cyan/white blocks at the clamped spot while hidden) and RETURNS (the LATEST capture shows them back). Milestone six closed — G1–G6 all live. |

### Readable paragraph form

**Milestone:** Six — graphics: Driving Award + Road Pops

**What it proved / is:** Boot to a **graphical interface**: a virtio-gpu framebuffer (G1), framebuffer text rendering (G2), the boot terminal re-targeted to the screen as **Road Pops** (G3), and the **Driving Award** window manager compositing multiple windows (G5), and a draw/window syscall seam for EL0 programs (G6). Keyboard/pointer input (the original G4) was split into **milestone seven** (USB XHCI + HID)

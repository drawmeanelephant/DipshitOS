## Milestone one — separate kernel image (implemented)

> Load a separate AArch64 kernel image and transfer control to its entry
> point.

**Implemented** (2026-08-05; branch `m1-kernel-handoff`, merged to `main`;
see `docs/decisions/0002-kernel-handoff.md`): the boot UEFI app loads
`\KERNEL.BIN` (flat format v1, magic "DSK1") from the ESP via the Simple
File System protocol, allocates `EfiLoaderCode` pages with Boot Services,
copies the image, performs D/I-cache maintenance, and jumps to the kernel
entry (handoff ABI: x0 = base, x1 = size, x2 = System Table, x3 = open
root directory; the kernel returns a u64 status). The kernel was then a
few hundred bytes of freestanding Zig that returned 0 *(historical
description of the M1 stub — superseded by the milestone-two kernel
proper)*.

Observed evidence on Apple M4 / macOS 27: `BOOTED.TXT` (loader ran),
`LOADER.TXT` (loader-observed placement, byte-perfect copy), `RC.TXT`
(`kernel_rc=0x0` — the kernel ran and returned), `MEMMAP.TXT`.

**Known issue (observed, RESOLVED 2026-08-05):** the kernel's own
`\KERNEL.TXT` write previously landed corrupted on Apple VZ firmware
(shifted slices of the kernel image's .rodata) while the loader's
identical writes were byte-perfect. Root cause: the loader loaded the
file verbatim, putting the 24-byte DSK1 header at `base+0` and the
content at `base+24`; LLVM's `adrp`+`add` references to `.rodata`
silently dropped the +24 header offset and read every literal 24 bytes
early. Fix: the loader now parses the header but places the content at
`base+0` (ELF VMA `V` at RAM `base+V`) and jumps to
`base + (entry_offset - 24)`. `KERNEL.TXT` is now byte-perfect and
byte-identical across runs, and `zig build run` **gates** on its content
(`DIPSHITOS KERNEL`, `entry reached via handoff`) in addition to
`BOOTED.TXT` and `RC.TXT`. Full investigation: ADR 0002 and
`artifacts/m1-run*.txt` / `m1-fix-*.txt`.

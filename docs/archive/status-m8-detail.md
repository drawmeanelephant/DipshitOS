### Readable paragraph form

**Milestone:** Eight — usability: human interface (ADR 0008)

**What it proved / is:** One command grammar + grouped `help` (D1), a real line editor (history, cursor, Ctrl chords, tab completion — D2), one `error:`/`usage:`/`unknown command` shape (D3), a visible-focus window model (D4), an `about`/`welcome`/`motd`/`sysinfo` support surface (D5), all enforced by gates (D6). Normative contract: [`docs/decisions/0008-human-interface-guidelines.md`](decisions/0008-human-interface-guidelines.md)

### Archived `## What comes immediately afterward` entries for M8

The `## What comes immediately afterward` section in pre-compression `docs/status.md` (lines 357–580)
contained 1 numbered entries that detailed M8's cards.
The entries have been removed from the live tracker; their substance lives in the march file and claims.
For historical fidelity, the original bullets that referenced M8 are excerpted below (see git history `docs/status.md` @ `aa4f111` for full section):

>     **Card U1 (claim 3275) DONE 2026-08-14** — the ADR 0008 D1 discovery
>     surface: `kernel/src/monitor.zig` gains a `Category` field on all 40
>     commands + a grouped `help` catalog in the D1 group order + `help <cmd>`
>     detail + `help <topic>` pages (networking, windows, storage, graphics;

>     **Card U2 (claim 1809) DONE 2026-08-14** — the ADR 0008 D2 editing
>     surface: a bounded history ring, cursor left/right + Home/End, Ctrl-
>     A/E/K/U/L/C, Delete, and tab completion in `kernel/src/lineedit.zig`;
>     arrow/Home/End/Delete usages + Ctrl-chord decoding in `kernel/src/input.zig`;
>     `\b`/`\r` honored in `kernel/src/text.zig`; the registry completer + repaint
>     wired in `kernel/src/shell.zig`; and the runner's `--input-chords` seam.
>     Live gate `tools/verify-live-editing.sh` PASS 1/1 on VZ (scripted chords
>     drive mid-line insert + Up recall; unchanged transcript paths stay
>     byte-identical). En route it root-caused + fixed a latent I3 interrupt-

>     `error: <actionable>` (`err_prefix`) across every refusal/failure site,
>     one `unknown command '<x>' -- try 'help'`. The byte-exact misuse
>     transcript now asserts all three shapes, and three deterministic host
>     fuzz tests (tokenizer / arbitrary argv / full editor+shell input path)
>     prove no handler panics. The full-path fuzz found + this card fixed a

>     help + live transcript gates re-run green.
>     **Card U5 (claim 0935) DONE 2026-08-14** — the ADR 0008 D4 chrome: a
>     white 3-px focus ring on the focused window (focus changes repaint),
>     title bars (name + owning pid) on user windows, `win cycle` + the
>     host-tested Alt+Tab decode for keyboard cycling; the new gate
>     `tools/verify-live-win-hig.sh` PASS 8/8 on VZ (scale-aware pixel
>     proof: ring on the focused window, terminal edge not ringed, the
>     title bar). **Card U4 (claim 4993) BLOCKED at the live seam** — the
>     guest side (click = focus + raise, the cursor, the axis mapping) is
>     host-tested and the runner `--pointer` seam landed, but five
>     synthesized pointer delivery routes all produced zero guest pointer
>     reports (hardware contract); the real-mouse observation and the
>     Accessibility-granted CG route are the recorded follow-ups. A latent
>     out-of-bounds write in `text.zig`'s render (the tiny-canvas host
>     test) was found and fixed (render is now canvas-bounded).
>     **Card U6 (claim 8323) DONE 2026-08-15** — the ADR 0008 D5 first-boot
>     experience: refreshed `about` with modern architecture realities (GICv3,
>     processes, FAT32, networking, windows, xHCI input), new `welcome` (alias
>     `tour`) guided walkthrough of the system, and a deterministic boot MOTD
>     status line (`motd: aarch64 el1 kernel live; scheduler, uaccess, fs, net, gfx, xhci armed.`);
>     class A transcript gate `tools/verify-transcript.sh` and live help gate
>     re-run green. The post-M8 candidate roadmap
>     (Milestone 9: Interactive EL0 Events, Milestone 10: Userland Filesystem ABI,
>     Milestone 11: Desktop Platform & GUI Apps, Milestone 12: Network Apps) is
>     structured in `docs/roadmap.md` (claim 4951).
>     **Card U7 (claim 2990) DONE 2026-08-15** — the ADR 0008 D5 `sysinfo` support
>     snapshot: canonical `sysinfo` command in `kernel/src/monitor.zig` (growing
>     registry 42 -> 43) unifying system, cpu/timer, memory, allocator,
>     scheduler, processes, storage, networking, graphics, and input diagnostics;
>     transcript fixture regenerated; class A gate `tools/verify-transcript.sh`,
>     unit tests, and live help gate re-run green.
>     **Card U8 (claim 2649) DONE 2026-08-15** — the ADR 0008 Card U8 persistent
>     settings engine: `kernel/src/settings.zig` provides in-memory key-value
>     configuration (`hostname`, `prompt`, `theme`, `scrollback`) backed by
>     `SETTINGS.TXT` on the DATA FAT32 partition; `cmd_settings` in `kernel/src/monitor.zig`
>     (growing registry 43 -> 44) implements `list`, `get`, `set`, `reset` verbs;
>     kernel boot initializes settings from the DATA partition, and `kernel/src/shell.zig`
>     dynamically renders the configured prompt. New class-B gate `tools/verify-live-settings.sh`
>     PASS 1/1 on VZ (two boots against same disk image: sets `hostname=elephant-box` and
>     custom prompt, fresh reboot confirms custom prompt and persisted hostname loaded).

> The command layer above is portable; `docs/archive/march-m15.md` step 15's filesystem-command **deferral is superseded 2026-08-09** — first by the pre-exit ESP file window (claim 3475) and then, **on the same day, by the real FAT32 storage driver (claim 6420)**: `ls`/`cat`/`write` now read and write the live ESP's FAT volume through a virtio-blk transport, so files persist on the disk itself and **no storage driver remains deferred**. The allocator, interrupts, first tasks, EL0 boundary, syscall ABI, uaccess, per-task address spaces, lifecycle, ESP exec, and blocking syscalls are all complete; **milestone three is closed 2026-08-10 (tag `m3-userspace`, claim 0707)**.

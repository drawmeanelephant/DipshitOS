### Readable paragraph form

**Milestone:** Seven — input: USB XHCI + HID (keyboard + pointer)

**What it proved / is:** Give Road Pops its FIRST screen-side keystrokes: an XHCI host-controller transport (I1 — MMIO + command/event rings + port status), USB enumeration + HID boot-protocol parsing (I2 — the keyboard + pointing devices behind the XHCI controller), and a bounded event FIFO + keycode decode feeding the line editor (I3). **Premise corrected 2026-08-13 (claim 3868):** VZ's `VZUSBKeyboardConfiguration` + `VZUSBScreenCoordinatePointingDeviceConfiguration` present as an **Apple XHCI USB controller** (`VID=0x106b DID=0x1a06 CLS=0x0c0330`, two MMIO BARs `0x50001000` + `0x50000000`) with the keyboard/pointer as USB HID devices behind it — the hypothesized virtio-input (DID 0x1052) does not exist in the framework.

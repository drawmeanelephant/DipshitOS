# Milestone 27 Dogfood & System Completeness Sweep Report

This document records the end-to-end verification, platform audits, and system dogfooding for **Milestone 27 (M27: Desktop Polish & Completeness Sweep)**, resolving issues #444 through #473 (Cards G1–G30).

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Milestone 27 combines new user-facing functionality and micro-widget toolkit extensions with a comprehensive platform-wide sweep and audit across 30 cards:

- **New M27 Software Deliveries:**
  - **Tooling & Diagnostics (G27, G28, G29):** Streaming 24-bpp framebuffer BMP writer to FAT32 (`fat.write_fb_bmp`), `screenshot [<path>]` monitor command, `help --all` 68-command catalog dump, and `shortcuts` matrix reference command.
  - **Core UI Micro-Widget Toolkit (G9, G10, G14, G22, G23):** `WidgetState` architecture wired into `Button` and `TextInput`, hierarchical `ContextMenu` / `Menu` with `MenuItemSpec` separators/shortcuts/keys, standard `Dialog` modal helpers (`show_dialog`), `draw_empty_state` presenter, and `format_error` errno-to-text formatter.
  - **Applications & Configuration (G2, G6, G16):** `SYSMON.BIN` System Monitor Dashboard with 1 Hz timer updates and full `build.zig`/`make-image.sh`/`APPS.TXT` wiring, 3-step First-Boot Setup Wizard in `SETTINGS.BIN`, and `settings reset` defaults restoration.
  - **Compositor & Focus Features (G3, G5, G13):** Modal `previous_focus` window restoration on About dialog close, `virtio_snd` action tones on notification toasts, and `focus_follows_mouse` setting integration.

- **Platform Audits & Verifications of Existing Features (G1, G4, G7, G8, G11, G12, G15, G17, G18, G19, G20, G21, G24, G25, G26, G30):**
  - Verification of pre-existing boot splash (`render_splash`), Alt-Tab nearest-neighbor preview rendering, hover tooltips, and drag/resize cursor cues.
  - Rigorous verification of WCAG 2.1 AA theme color contrast, zero-leak process termination, window boundary coordinate clamping, timer disarm cancellation, and bounded command history.

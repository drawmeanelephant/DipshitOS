## Wishlist / hope chest (destinations, not commitments)

The bridges the maintainer would be **most disappointed to see omitted** —
from "very capable kernel" to "weird little computer" — are **EL0 application
events, userland filesystem access, consumer apps, and a lightweight
app/launcher model** (items 2, 5, 4, and 10 below).

1. **Finish M8 as the usability consolidation milestone.** Help,
   editing/history, coherent errors, pointer focus/cursor, window chrome,
   first-boot experience, `sysinfo`, persistent settings — no giant new
   subsystem hiding inside it. *(This is the current, real milestone — see
   above.)*
2. **Interactive EL0 application events** *(the biggest near-term want)*.
   Per-process event queues: keyboard, pointer/button, focus/blur, close
   requests, and probably a blocking/polling event syscall. This is what turns
   graphical syscall demos into actual applications.
3. **A tiny userland application support layer.** Not a GUI framework — just
   enough shared Zig for app startup, event loops, windows, drawing, basic
   strings, and syscall wrappers. Build a couple apps first and extract only
   what they genuinely duplicate.
4. **Several deliberately small GUI apps.** Calculator, a notepad-ish thing,
   process viewer, network monitor, a dumb paint thing. Architectural probes
   disguised as toys: if every one needs a kernel modification, the app
   boundary is wrong.
5. **Userland filesystem access.** Handles (or a Dipshit-native equivalent),
   read/write/create, directory enumeration, metadata, paths — deliberately
   **before** any graphical file manager.
6. **A graphical file browser.** Read-mostly at first: browse DATA, open text
   files; create/rename/delete later. The integration proof for events +
   windows + filesystem APIs.
7. **Userland TCP/network API.** UDP already crossed the boundary; eventually
   let EL0 own connections without cloning POSIX sockets by reflex. Then make
   a real user network client consume it.
8. **DNS.** Once an EL0 network app exists, numeric IPs get stupid fast. Keep
   it bounded and boring initially.
9. **Application identity/metadata.** A tiny manifest or image-metadata
   concept: name, executable, maybe an icon later, the file types it
   understands — so the launcher/file manager stop hardcoding knowledge.
10. **A launcher.** Could start hilariously simple: list installed apps, run
    one. Alongside the file browser, this is when DipshitOS gets a recognizable
    "desktop" shape.
11. **Clipboard / shared user-interaction services.** Probably later; text
    apps will make the absence obvious. Discover the right IPC/service model
    through this rather than inventing "system services" abstractly.
12. **Timers/events available to applications.** Apps shouldn't spin or invent
    sleep loops to animate/update; a clean timer-event mechanism fits after the
    event queue exists.
13. **Resource-model cleanup when the fixed pools hurt.** Windows, processes,
    mailboxes, and network state are wonderfully bounded now — keep them that
    way until real apps expose actual pain, *then* introduce dynamic kernel
    objects/allocators because the workload demands it. *(Started 2026-08-19 —
    M16 C3, claim 0339: the scheduler executor pool grew 7→11 (8 live user
    programs) because the apps exhausted the old four; the other pools stay
    bounded — the "grow only what hurts" rule applied, live on VZ.)*
14. **Richer virtual memory only when applications force it.** More flexible
    mappings, guard pages, larger programs, maybe mmap-ish primitives, COW much
    later. No demand paging merely because Serious-OS bingo says so. *(Started
    2026-08-19 — M16 C2, claim 8403: guard pages below the stack / above the
    data segment and EL0-fault → reap, live on VZ.)*
15. **Executable-format evolution.** The DSK1 flat-image model has done heroic
    work; larger programs/libraries may eventually justify ELF loading or
    another structured native format. Consumer first. *(Started 2026-08-19 —
    M16 C1, claim 3805: the DSK3 segmented image with writable data + zeroed
    BSS and a 256 KiB load bound, live on VZ.)*
16. **Reusable UI toolkit, but late.** Buttons, labels, text fields, lists,
    scrolling, layout — *after* two or three hand-built apps have shown what
    the common pieces actually are. Otherwise someone lovingly architects
    GTKdipshit before anyone has clicked a button.
17. **Better filesystem semantics eventually.** Atomic-ish updates, truncation,
    deletion, rename, free-space management, corruption handling, maybe beyond
    FAT32 someday — but let applications create the pressure first.
18. **Audio eventually.** Fun, and another real device/service pipeline. Not
    remotely urgent; on the "DipshitOS becomes a computer" list.
19. **Security/isolation hardening.** More permissions around resources,
    stronger validation of userspace-controlled arguments, process ownership
    everywhere, maybe capabilities — grown *alongside* userland power, not as
    one giant Security Milestone.
20. **Distant mountains (keep visible, do not climb yet).** SMP, 3D
    acceleration, dynamic linking, sophisticated VM, POSIX compatibility,
    browser-grade networking, USB-everything. Keep them on the map so nobody
    thinks we forgot them — but no agent should see "mountain" and immediately
    buy climbing gear.

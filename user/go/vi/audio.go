// M58e (issue #1328): the EL0 audio seam — ADR 0007 slots 42/43, the Go half
// of what user/src/jingle.zig and user/src/chime.zig do in Zig. The kernel
// side has been frozen since M15; this file adds no syscall, it marshals.
//
// AudioInfo is slot 42's out struct: 16 bytes, little-endian, the kernel's
// field order and widths (kernel/src/virtio_snd.zig `AudioInfo`, mirrored by
// tests/virelai.h struct v_audio_info and docs/wasm-import-contract.md §5.3):
//
//	 0  ready        u32  transport + stream armed (0 = no device, not negotiated)
//	 4  format       u8   negotiated FMT_* (AudioFmtNone when there is no device)
//	 5  rate         u8   negotiated RATE_*
//	 6  channels     u8
//	 7  padding      u8
//	 8  period_bytes u32  the TX period the kernel submits (4096 on the device VZ reports)
//	12  max_len      u32  the slot-43 length bound (64 KiB)
//
// 16 bytes, not 24: the M15 card text said "24-byte AudioInfo", ADR 0007's
// slot-42 row and the kernel handler's comment both copied that, but the
// struct has been 16 bytes since it landed (asserted there by @sizeOf and in
// the frozen WAT contract). The stale comments are corrected with this card.
// TestAudioInfoWireSize pins the layout, because a struct that claims 24 bytes
// here would marshal 8 bytes of whatever follows the kernel's copy_out.
//
// A soundless VM (the default VM, no `--sound`) is NOT an error at slot 42:
// the kernel runs its first-call probe, fails to negotiate, and reports
// ready=0 with format/rate = 0xff. Slot 43 is where the honest refusal
// surfaces — ENXIO, the typed ErrNoAudioDevice — and that is what an app
// reports ("documented, not a failure" in the card's words).
//
// All four slots go through the HOOKABLE gateway (svc1/svc2 in vi.go) rather
// than the raw assembly, the same seam M66a (#1443) opened for the file
// surface. That is what lets a host test pin what this binding SENDS, not just
// what it returns: in particular that an out-of-range volume is handed to the
// kernel to refuse rather than quietly clamped here.
//
// M70f2 (#1476) adds slots 44/45 to this file, so the audio seam stays one
// place: 42/43 were already here and FART.ELF imports it. Splitting the four
// rows across `vi` and `vsys` would make one subsystem span two packages.

// been refused with ENAMETOOLONG), and the accounting is per period, so a
// failure names how much sound was already confirmed. Chunking allocates
// nothing: the chunks are sub-slices of pcm.
//
// A mid-buffer failure returns the bytes confirmed so far alongside the error,
// so a caller can never over-claim what played. A submission the kernel
// answers with FEWER bytes than it was handed is a device-level refusal
// (ErrNoAudioDevice), not data loss to ignore. An empty buffer is a no-op:

//! DipshitOS user program loaded from the ESP (milestone-three card 6,
//! claim 6783; extended by card 7, claim 0635 — blocking syscalls).
//!
//! Built as a freestanding AArch64 flat image (USER.BIN, DSK1 format via
//! tools/elf2bin.py — the same tooling as KERNEL.BIN), embedded on the ESP
//! by the image builder, read through the claim-6420 FAT path by the
//! kernel's `exec` monitor command, and entered at EL0 under a fresh user
//! root that maps this page at `userspace.text_va`.
//!
//! The payload is deliberately identical in shape to the claim-8215 static
//! payload (naked asm, fixed register ABI only — no Zig-generated memory
//! references or calls): it proves the loaded image actually executes at
//! EL0 by (1) writing marker lines through sys_write (fd 1, slot 1), which
//! land directly in the serial log, (2) round-tripping two sequenced
//! sys_ping calls (slot 0) — the second valid call proves the first SVC
//! returned to EL0 — (3) cooperatively yielding once (sys_yield, slot 2),
//! (4) sleeping for 2 scheduler ticks (sys_sleep, slot 4) and asserting the
//! 0 return — the claim-0635 blocking proof: the payload is parked
//! (state=blocked), the tick's timer-driven wakeup resumes it from the same
//! SVC frame, and execution continues — and (5) exiting with a distinct
//! status (0x2b = 43) through the non-returning sys_exit (slot 3), closing
//! the claim-6729 lifecycle. The terminal branch is only a fail-safe park
//! if a ping round-trip or the sleep return comes back wrong.

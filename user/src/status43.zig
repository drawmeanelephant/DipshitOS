//! VirelaiOS fourth ESP user program — STATUS43.BIN (milestone-four
//! follow-on 4, card 4c — claim 9946).
//!
//! The SHORT third program in the exit-status-propagation gate: the
//! observer (COUNTER.BIN, exec'd with the wait target pid in its argv)
//! blocks in `sys_wait` (slot 8) until THIS program exits, then reads the
//! status back. This program makes the block deterministic: it prints its
//! alive marker, SLEEPS for `sleep_ticks` scheduler ticks (slot 4) — a
//! multi-second window in which the observer execs, issues its wait, and
//! is observed blocked while the target is still alive — then prints its
//! exiting marker and calls sys_exit (slot 3) with status 43. The kernel's
//! exit path records the status AND wakes the waiter, patching 43 into
//! the waiter's saved frame.
//!
//! Same naked-asm, fixed-register-ABI shape as every other ESP program
//! (no Zig-generated memory references or calls; sys_write for the two
//! markers, sys_sleep for the window, sys_exit for the status). The
//! terminal branch is a fail-safe park if the sleep return comes back
//! wrong.
//!
//! The marker bytes, the sleep length, and the exit status are exposed as
//! `pub const`s so the host tests pin the EXACT shapes (the live gate's
//! grep targets and the observed status) and the payload cannot drift.

//! VirelaiOS sched-ring stress task — SCHEDRING.BIN (claim 881, #856
//! slice 4 — the live proof for the per-core ready rings).
//!
//! The gate runs TWO SCHEDRING.BIN processes: one PINNED to core 1
//! (`exec -c1 SCHEDRING.BIN` — home ring 1) and one FLOATING (`exec
//! SCHEDRING.BIN` — home ring 0, stolen onto core 1 by the idle-branch
//! steal view, also claimable by core 0). Each program then:
//!
//!   1. Runs `sleep_count` × sys_sleep(1) — every wake is a ring resume,
//!      so a LOST wakeup hangs the program before the slept marker and
//!      fails the gate; a DUPLICATE staging (two cores on one TCB) would
//!      corrupt the shared frame/counter and fail the exact-count greps
//!      (or crash).
//!   2. Runs `yield_count` × sys_yield in a tight loop — the counter
//!      lives in x19, which the vector frame saves/restores across every
//!      switch, so any save/restore corruption breaks the exact count.
//!   3. Writes its exact-count markers and exits 0 — `slept=4` /
//!      `yielded=32` / `done` must each land EXACTLY TWICE in the gate's
//!      serial log (once per process), together with two exit/reap
//!      reports and the kernel's `smp: secondary runs=N
//!      task=SCHEDRING.BIN` evidence line.
//!
//! Same naked-asm, fixed-register-ABI shape as every other ESP program
//! (no Zig-generated memory references or calls). The marker bytes, the
//! loop counts, and the exit status are exposed as `pub const`s so the
//! host tests pin the EXACT shapes (the live gate's grep targets) and
//! the payload cannot drift.

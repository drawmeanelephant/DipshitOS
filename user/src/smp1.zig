//! VirelaiOS SMP user task — SMP1.BIN (claim 2369: locked console TX +
//! user tasks on secondary cores).
//!
//! The FIRST user program that runs on a secondary core: `exec -c1 SMP1.BIN`
//! pins its task to core 1, so every syscall below executes on that core
//! (the kernel's per-core scheduler state, claim 8477, plus the now-locked
//! serial TX make that safe). The program's shape exercises every core-1
//! seam end to end:
//!
//!   1. sys_write the hello marker from core 1 (locked console TX — core 0
//!      prints heartbeats/reports concurrently, so the exact-line greps in
//!      the live gate prove no byte interleaving).
//!   2. sys_sleep 2 ticks — the SVC has no eligible successor on core 1,
//!      so the kernel PARKS core 1 back on its WFE loop (the claim-2369
//!      park path); core 0's tick wakes the task and core 1's next tick
//!      resumes it from its saved SVC frame.
//!   3. sys_write the exiting marker from core 1, then sys_exit(0) — the
//!      exit also parks core 1; core 0's reaper frees the zombie.
//!
//! Same naked-asm, fixed-register-ABI shape as every other ESP program (no
//! Zig-generated memory references or calls). The marker bytes, the sleep
//! length, and the exit status are exposed as `pub const`s so the host
//! tests pin the EXACT shapes (the live gate's grep targets) and the
//! payload cannot drift.
